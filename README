Welcome to FAQtor.

To manually run FAQtor:

faqtor.py yourinput.xml [yourconfig.cfg]

or use the GNUMakefile to automatically run faqtor and place the output in the parent directory.

for information regarding the XML and CFG file formats please refer to the documents:
README.xml and README.cfg.  

Additionally, you can view sample.xml and sample.cfg for examples of those files. 


TO DO:
======

1. Currently, answers can not easily be linked to others or from other pages (without knowing the
exact section # & question # (because FAQtor generates these).  I will address this in the next
release by allowing an optional name argument to be associated with an answer.

eg.

<answer name="answer to silly question">This is a silly answer</answer>

UPDATE: This task has been completed as of v0.6.



2. Currently, the XML file cannot contain HTML markup (since it confuses the XML parser).  The
author of the XML file needs to escape the markup which can be tedious.  I'm thinking of creating a
preprocessor that does the escaping automatically so that the author can worry about more import
things.

UPDATE: This task has been completed in v0.7.
